Hi there!

This is my solution to your challenge, I was thinking on adding more stuff to make it fancier, like environment variables, dependency injection or inversion of control library, swagger, but I think it was out of the scope of the challenge itself so I did a more straightforward solution.

You can try it out [here](https://dry-fjord-25820.herokuapp.com/)

The endpoint is `GET: /consumption?yearlyConsumption=NUMBER`

To run it locally you have to do 
```
npm i && npm run start
```
It will run in the port 3000

To run the test yo have to use
```
npm test
```
